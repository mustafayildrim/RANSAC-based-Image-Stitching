# RANSAC-based-Image-Stitching
This project implements image stitching using RANSAC-based affine and homography transformations to create panoramas. The objective is to construct wide-angle images by aligning and blending multiple images with overlapping fields of view while ensuring robust feature matching and transformation estimation.
